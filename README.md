# Module-5-Group
This is my work for the group portion of module 5 (I got an extension for this module)

Note: I wasn't able to flesh everything out. I believe my structues/techniques were good, I just didn't
have the ability to get it all out and debug. Idk how much partial credit ya'll are allowed to give for 
getting close to fully implementing stuff, but anything is greatly appreciated. 
Also, most of why I wasn't able to test stuff is because logging in and out doesn't work, and I never
got a good answer from a TA about why that is, so I just had to code without really being able to 
test it. 
Creative Portion Notes: Similar to above, I don't thinK I got it fully fleshed out, and I couldn't 
really test it, but I worked on making it so that hte user could share events with other users.
I know that isn't enough for full points on the creative portion, but I got done what I could (the
probably 1000 lines I did write were time consuming). I had plans for the structure of getting 
categories done, but again I didn't have time. 
Also, thanks again for the extension. I know I didn't do great on this module, but I would have 
done so much worse without the extension. I'll just have to slay on the next module. 
Small additional note: for the validator, a TA told me that doing <label name="x"></label> was
fine, so are those validator errors still considered errors?
